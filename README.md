## Workshop Description ##
Abstract: Federated query processing and query federation engines are powerful systems that enable users to access and query distributed data sources without centralizing and, thus, duplicating data. Federated query processing supports real-time aggregation, enhances data privacy, and promotes flexibility and agility in data management. However, there are still challenges in making such functionality accessible to users. We invite proposals from innovative and experienced teams or individuals to address key challenges associated with simplifying complex query authoring, improving data source discovery, and streamlining integration and schema mapping in the context of distributed data querying.


The primary objective of this call for proposals is to facilitate advancements in federated query processing technology, with a specific focus on enhancing the user experience and the user efficiency for the querying federations of data sources. More particularly, we are seeking solutions to overcome the following challenges:

- Complex Query Authoring: Improve the ease in which to construct queries over federations. Potential solutions include conversational AI, AI-guided interfaces, query builders, query recommendation systems, and query templates.
- Data Source Discovery: Reduce the time and effort in identifying and recommending relevant data sources. Potential solutions include data source catalogs, metadata generation, and recommendation systems. 
- Federated Data Integration: Technologies that map and stitch together schemas from different sources, uncover data-centric connection points (e.g., value profiling and identifier types), and related methods.

## Agenda ##
The agenda can be found [here](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/FedQuery2024/blob/7d4ccfa7ea9fd29f3c221a89281ae86d6ed8e98e/agenda.md).

## Registration ##
The participants have been invited by the organizers. Participants whose participation is funded by the DKG COST Action will receive an official invitation email from the Action and will need to accept that invitation by logging in to the [COST portal](http://e-services.cost.eu/). To this end, they need to create an account at the portal, unless they already have one (which should be the case for all members of working groups of the Action). 

### Transportation ###
Metro and buses are very convenient in Malaga city and between airport to the city center as well.
More practical information can be found [here](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/FedQuery2024/blob/main/Malaga-Venue-Indications-2024.pdf)


### Accommodation ###
For participants funded by the COST Action, the expenses for accommodation are included in the daily allowance. Please note that the daily allowance includes your hotel stays and meals.

### Reimbursement ###
It is **very important** to sign the attendance sheet every single day when you are in the workshop. This is required for us to get the funding from the COST Action and, for participants reimbursed by that funding, to get their reimbursement.

For participants funded by the COST Action, after the event, you will need to fill a claim form in the COST portal. The claim form will be available after you accept the invitation to this workshop (see above). You will need to fill in your arrival and departure time and upload travel tickets. In contrast to the travel allowance, for claiming the daily allowance (which is also meant to cover your accommodation, in addition to meals) you do *not* need to provide any proof (such as hotel invoice or receipts for meals).

Please read COST Action Travel Reimbursement Rules (from 2022) about what can or cannot be reimbursed by our funder: https://www.cost.eu/uploads/2022/09/Travel-Reimbursement-Rules_March_2022.pdf
